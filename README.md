# CircuitSolver
## ***Objective***
*This project aims to create LTspice schematic from hand-drawn circuits for the students who are not familiar with the interface of simulators.*
## ***Working***
*It will recognize each component of a circuit and create its corresponding schematic.*<br/>
*We have used segmentation using an algorithm for identification of open line elements capacitor, battery, ground, resistor etc.*<br/>
